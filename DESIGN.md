# Reference / Rail — Design System

## Overview

Reference / Rail is a field edition for authored learning roadmaps. A thin vermilion rail connects route numbers, progress marks, prerequisites, and stages so the content reads as a sequence rather than a card catalog.

## Colors

- Bone paper: #EEE9DC with deep paper edge #D9D0BE.
- Iron ink: #242321.
- Quiet ink: #6E6A61.
- Rubric rail: #B8322D.
- Wash: #E5DFD1 and intermediate green: #4D6B59.

## Typography

- Georgia is the main reference-setting voice for headings and roadmap titles.
- Geist Mono is used for route labels, metadata, progress, and navigation.
- Large headings preserve a wide editorial measure; stage lists use small, generous leading.
- Color is sparse so the content and rail stay authoritative.

## Layout

- The index uses a broad reference header followed by a ruled route list.
- Every route entry has a number column, a central rail, and a content field.
- Detail pages reuse the same sheet with prerequisites above an ordered stage sequence.
- The rail moves from the margin to the content edge on mobile without losing order.

## Elevation & Depth

- One paper shadow grounds the sheet on the work surface.
- Rules and paper washes provide hierarchy instead of nested cards.
- Progress is a flat rubric line; it is metadata, not a dashboard widget.

## Shapes

- Hairlines, square marks, open whitespace, and one-pixel rails.
- Prerequisites use underlined text rather than pill chips.
- No rounded cards, gradients, or generic iconography.

## Components

- Edition masthead: identity, field edition, and static MDX boundary.
- Route entry: ordinal, rail, title, metadata, progress line, and open link.
- Detail header: route category, title, difficulty, schedule, and marked percentage.
- Stage row: sequence number, rail, stage title, and authored item list.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do treat stages as ordered content and keep the route easy to revisit.
- Do label progress as sample/reference metadata.
- Don't imply account-based progress sync or live labor-market truth.
- Don't collapse the route library into equal icon cards or a generic SaaS dashboard.

## Storybook

Storybook 10 (`@storybook/nextjs-vite`) shows this design system with the app's real CSS, tokens and fonts.

```bash
npm run storybook        # http://localhost:6006
npm run build-storybook  # static build in storybook-static/ (CI: .github/workflows/storybook.yml)
```

- **Foundations/Tokens** reads every CSS custom property the app defines at runtime, so it never drifts from the code.
- **Design/DESIGN.md** renders this file.
- **Components/**, **Sections/** and **Pages/** show the UI with mock data only (no network, analytics off).
- Toolbar: locale, theme (light / dark), viewports 320 / 375 / 768 / 1440. The a11y panel runs axe (WCAG 2.2 AA).
- Rule: a new shared component or page section ships with a story in `stories/`.
